## Hello! I'm Jeanne, a second-year pre-law student at UC San Diego studying Cognitive Science: Machine Learning & Neural Computation. ˚ʚ♡ɞ˚

My research experience lies in neuroscience, studying at the cellular level. Through various experiences, I've found a passion for the protection of intellectual property and hope to pursue a career in patent law. 

I am eager to contribute to initiatives that combine neuroscience and computation/modeling so that I may strengthen my knowledge before entering the legal field!
